# SantaFe Short-Term Rentals
aka Will I Have Any Neighbors Left Now that Everything's A Short term Rental?

I pulled some data about short-term rental licenses that were issued by the Santa Fe City Department in 2025, and mapped them to see who was stealing my neighbors from me.

**Overview:**
- Santa Fe issued 1100+ Short Term Rental Licenses in 2025
- Most of them (~60%) were in my zipcode / downtown
- Assuming each person paid $425 ($100 filing, $325 annual fee), that's ~$400K for the city
- Also, the website csv export doesn't work, which makes me wonder what they're spending all that money on...
